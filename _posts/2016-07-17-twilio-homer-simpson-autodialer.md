As a big fan of *The Simpsons*, one of my first thoughts upon working with Twilio's API was the potential to re-enact [Homer Simpon's auto-dialer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-inCB3POqs), and bring a smile to the faces of a few friends who share a love for the cartoon. 
Ultimately it stood as a good excuse to work on a project with Twilio and and Node.js Express web app. 

It's said that 'with great power comes great responsibility'. I figure it worth adding *great consequences* to that, and of course in that sense it's worth noting that this project was only used to call a select handful of friends and not to spam the public.
