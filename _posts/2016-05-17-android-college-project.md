This app was created as part of a group project for the University of Limerick module *CS4084 - Mobile Application Development*
We were required to design and implement a *prototype* app which polled an API of our choosing. 

The objective of this module was to give a grounding not just in coding but in user interface design.
As of such, alongside coding, I took an interest in the wireframing and design of the app. On my suggestion, we 
utilised Google's material design icons as image buttons on the app's home screen.

Source code and screenshots of the finished app are accessible [here](https://github.com/oisinBates/CS4056BitcoinApp)
