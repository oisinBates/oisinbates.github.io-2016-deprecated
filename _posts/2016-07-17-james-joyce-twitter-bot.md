It's been said that James Joyce's lengthy novel *Ulysses* is so cryptic and oftentimes confusing, that the reader could spend a lifetime opening the book at random, always finding a new perspective. Though a number of Twitter accounts already tweet in 140 character blocks of text, I felt there to be a gap for a new approach: tweeting short sections text as the novel's pre-existing formatting

I was able to source a Joyce portrait under a Universal Creative Commons license from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/JamesJoyceVariousPhotos)
The text to Ulysses is freely available at [gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4300)

section of the book is includedatthe4 bottom of the page
