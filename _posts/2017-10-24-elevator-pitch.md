Amazon Web Services' 'Polly' is a text-to-speech service which synthesizes speech that sounds like a human voice.
As I was recently applying for a role which included the development of voice user interfaces on AWS, it seemed fitting to accompany my application with an elevator pitch, generated of course with Polly.
